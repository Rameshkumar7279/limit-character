# Character Limit Textarea with Real-Time Count

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a textarea with a **character limit** and **real-time character count** display using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It shows users how many characters they have typed and how many they have remaining before reaching the limit.

## Features

- **Character Limit**: The textarea has a maximum limit of 150 characters.
- **Real-Time Count**: As users type, they can see how many characters theyâ€™ve used and how many they have left.
- **Dynamic Styling**: The character count text will turn red if the user exceeds the limit.
- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the form and textarea.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to the form and textarea, including error colors.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic to count characters in real-time and display the count dynamically.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the basic structure of the form with a textarea that has a character limit.
- `styles.css`: Adds styling for the textarea, including responsive design and error styling for when the character limit is exceeded.
- `script.js`: Adds JavaScript functionality to count characters in real time and update the display.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rameshkumar7279/character-limit-textarea.git
   ```

2. **Open the HTML file**: Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

   ```bash
   cd character-limit-textarea
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Interact with the Textarea**: Start typing in the textarea. The character count below the textarea will update in real time, showing how many characters have been used out of the 150 allowed.

## Project Structure

### HTML (index.html)

The form structure includes:
- A `textarea` with a `maxlength` attribute of 150 characters.
- A `small` tag to display the current character count.

### CSS (styles.css)

- Provides styling for the `textarea`, including basic padding, font size, and a border.
- The `small` tag is styled to display the character count, and changes to red when the limit is exceeded.

### JavaScript (script.js)

- Tracks the number of characters typed in the `textarea`.
- Updates the `small` tag in real time with the number of characters used and remaining.
- Changes the color of the character count to red if the user exceeds the limit.



### Real-Time Count Example in Action

When a user starts typing, the `small` tag below the `textarea` will dynamically update. For example:
- **5 characters typed**: "5/150 characters used"
- **150 characters typed**: "150/150 characters used" (the limit)
- **More than 150 characters**: The text will change color to alert the user that they have exceeded the limit.
